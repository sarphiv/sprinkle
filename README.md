# ü™Ñ‚ú®Sprinkle‚ú®
Sprinkle is used to simplify deployment of Python scripts to DTU's High Performance Computing Cluster. 
It may also work for other languages, but this has not been tested.


# ‚úÖ Feature list
- Automatic **Miniconda** installation
- Automatic setup of environment
- Job submission with arguments passed to job
- Interactive stopping of jobs
- View job output, log, and errors
- View job status including **CPU and memory usage**
- Change job settings
- Export submission script to file


# üöÄ Installation
On DTU's HPC cluster, simply run the following commands.

```bash
wget -O 'sprinkle-installer' 'https://raw.githubusercontent.com/sarphiv/sprinkle/main/bin/sprinkle' && chmod u+x sprinkle-installer && ./sprinkle-installer update && rm -f sprinkle-installer && source ~/.profile && sprinkle update && sprinkle help
```

<details>
  <summary>Description of the above commands</summary>

  ```bash
  # Downloads newest version of sprinkle
  $ wget -O 'sprinkle-installer' 'https://raw.githubusercontent.com/sarphiv/sprinkle/main/bin/sprinkle'
  # Makes the script executable
  $ chmod u+x sprinkle-installer
  # Runs the installation script
  $ ./sprinkle-installer update
  # Delete downloaded sprinkle file
  $ rm -f sprinkle-installer
  # Update environment variables of current shell
  $ source ~/.profile
  # Run installed sprinkle for final setup
  $ sprinkle update
  # Display help view
  $ sprinkle help
  ```
</details>


# üëâ Usage
All commands below should be ‚ùó **run in your project directory** ‚ùó.

1. **On your local machine**
    1. Transfer project directory to DTU's HPC cluster _(see FAQ below)_
2. **On DTU's HPC cluster**
    1. `sprinkle start` and then enter job parameters _(such as main script, CPU cores, memory, and time)_
    0. `sprinkle help` _(view other commands)_

Sprinkle will attempt to automatically detect and setup your packages.
If this fails, check the FAQ below for how to create an environment file.

# üìñ Frequently asked questions
<details>
  <summary><b>How do I create the environment file?</b></summary>

  There are multiple ways. If no environment file (or requirements file) is specified, 
  Sprinkle will attempt to automatically create one for you. 
  If your script fails because of the above, you may need use one of the methods below.
  Once you are done, run `sprinkle settings` and select your environment file.

  - Either __**manually write the `environment.yml` file**__ (‚≠ê **Recommended method** ‚≠ê)
    1. Create a new file called `environment.yml` (can be done with `touch environment.yml`)
    0. Write your environment file (example below, version numbers can be specified).
        ```yaml
        name: new_environment_name
        channels:
          - defaults
          - conda-forge
          - pytorch
        dependencies:
          - pip=22.3.1
          - python=3.10.8
          - pytorch
          - pytorch-cuda
          - torchvision
          - torchaudio
          - pip:
            - scikit-learn
            - tqdm==4.61.1
            - opencv-python
        ```
  - Or __**export your existing environment**__
    ```bash
    conda activate <environment name>
    conda env export > environment.yml
    ```
  - Or __**create a new environment**__
    ```bash
    conda create -n new_environment_name
    conda activate new_environment_name
    conda install <package_name1> <package_name2> ...
    pip install <package_name1> <package_name2> ...
    conda env export > environment.yml
    ```

  Remember the `environment.yml` file 
  should be created **before transfering your project to DTU's HPC cluster**.
  This way you can test your code with your environment on your own computer first.
  It is much easier to test, find, and fix issues there than on DTU's HPC cluster.

<details>
  <summary><b>How do I transfer my project to DTU's HPC cluster?</b></summary>

  1. **On your own computer**, navigate through a terminal to the directory **CONTAINING** your project directory.
      - Example: If your project is in `~/DTU/12345/project_directory`, navigate to `~/DTU/012345`.
  0. Run `scp -r project_directory s123456@transfer.gbar.dtu.dk:project_directory`
  0. Wait for the upload to finish

  If the above fails, contact [HPC support](https://www.hpc.dtu.dk/) for more information and guidance.
</details>

<details>
  <summary><b>Where are my script's output, log, and errors?</b></summary>

  In a bunch of files in a hidden directory called `.sprinkle` in your project directory.
</details>

<details>
  <summary><b>My script doesn't work on DTU's HPC cluster.</b></summary>

  Check the error, log, and output files with `sprinkle view error job_id`, 
  where `job_id` is for your failed job.

  The error, log, and output files can also be found 
  in a hidden directory called `.sprinkle` in your project directory.
</details>

<details>
  <summary><b>How do I connect to DTU's HPC cluster?</b></summary>

  Use `ssh s123456@login.hpc.dtu.dk` or `ThinLinc` to connect to DTU's HPC cluster.
  If you use `ssh` remember to run `linuxsh` to not overload the login node.
  Contact [HPC support](https://www.hpc.dtu.dk/) for more information and guidance.
</details>

<details>
  <summary><b>How do I enable developer mode for sprinkle?</b></summary>

  Add a file called `DEVELOPER-MODE` to `~/sprinkle/tmp/`.
  The next call to sprinkle will switch branches and recreate the environment.
  Remove the file to leave developer mode upon the next call to sprinkle.
</details>
