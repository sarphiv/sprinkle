# üöÄ Installation
On DTU's HPC cluster, simply run the following commands.

```bash
wget -O 'sprinkle-installer' 'https://raw.githubusercontent.com/sarphiv/sprinkle/main/bin/sprinkle' && chmod u+x sprinkle-installer && ./sprinkle-installer update && rm -f sprinkle-installer && source ~/.profile && sprinkle update && sprinkle help
```

# üëâ Usage
1. **On your local machine**
    1. Activate your project's environment with `conda activate <environment name>`.
    0. In your project directory, export your packages with `conda env export > environment.yml`.
    0. Transfer project directory to DTU's HPC cluster with e.g. `scp` or `ThinLinc`. 
2. **On DTU's HPC cluster**
    1. Run `sprinkle start` in your project directory.
    0. Run `sprinkle help` to view other commands.


# üìñ Frequently asked questions
## My single conda environment is a mess, I do not want to export it.
Then you need to make a new conda environment with `conda create -n new_environment_name`,
install the necessary packages to make it work with your project, and then follow the original instructions.
For the record, it is recommended to make an environment for each DTU course and/or project instead of a single environment.

An alternative is to manually write the `environment.yml` file (cleanest option).
You can use [sprinkle's environment file](https://github.com/sarphiv/sprinkle/blob/main/environment.yml) for inspiration.

Whatever you do, test your code with your new environment on your computer first.
It is much easier to find and fix issues there than on DTU's HPC cluster.

## How do I transfer my project to DTU's HPC cluster?
1. **On your own computer**, navigate a throough a terminal to the directory **CONTAINING** your project directory.
0. Run `scp -r project_directory_on_your_computer s123456@student.dtu.dk@transfer.gbar.dtu.dk:where_you_want_it_on_DTU_HPC`
0. Wait for the upload to finish

## Where are my script's output, log, and errors?
In a hidden folder called `.sprinkle` in your project's directory.

## How do I enable developer mode for sprinkle?
Add a file called `DEVELOPER-MODE` to `~/sprinkle/tmp/`.
The next call to sprinkle will switch branches and recreate the environment.
Remove the file to leave developer mode upon the next call to sprinkle.


# üóî CLI
