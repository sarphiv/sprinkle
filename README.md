# üöÄ Installation
On DTU's HPC cluster, simply run the following commands.

```bash
wget -O 'sprinkle-installer' 'https://raw.githubusercontent.com/sarphiv/sprinkle/main/bin/sprinkle' && chmod u+x sprinkle-installer && ./sprinkle-installer update && rm -f sprinkle-installer && source ~/.profile && sprinkle update && sprinkle help
```

  # Makes the script executable
  $ chmod u+x sprinkle-installer
  # Runs the installation script
  $ ./sprinkle-installer update
  # Delete downloaded sprinkle file
  $ rm -f sprinkle-installer
  # Update environment variables of current shell

# üëâ Usage
All commands below should be ‚ùó **run in your project directory** ‚ùó.

1. **On your local machine**
    1. `conda activate <environment name>` _(activate your project's environment)_
    0. `conda env export > environment.yml` _(or create the environment file manually - see FAQ below)_
    0. Transfer project directory to DTU's HPC cluster _(see FAQ below)_
2. **On DTU's HPC cluster**
    1. `sprinkle start` and then enter job parameters _(such as CPU cores, memory, time, and main script)_
    0. `sprinkle help` _(view other commands)_


# üìñ Frequently asked questions
<details>
  <summary><b>How do I create the environment file?</b></summary>

  There are multiple ways. However, remember the `environment.yml` file 
  should be created **before transfering your project to DTU's HPC cluster**.

  - Either __**create a new environment**__
    ```bash
    conda create -n new_environment_name
    conda activate new_environment_name
    conda install <package_name1> <package_name2> ...
    pip install <package_name1> <package_name2> ...
    conda env export > environment.yml
    ```
  - Or __**manually write the `environment.yml` file**__
    1. Create a new file called `environment.yml` (can be done with `touch environment.yml`)
    0. Write your environment file (example below, version numbers can be specified).
        ```yaml
        name: new_environment_name
        channels:
          - defaults
          - conda-forge
          - pytorch
        dependencies:
          - python
          - pip
          - pytorch
          - pytorch-cuda
          - torchvision
          - torchaudio
          - pip:
            - scikit-learn
            - opencv-python
            - tqdm
        ```

  Test your code with your new environment on your own computer first.
  It is much easier to find and fix issues there than on DTU's HPC cluster.

<details>
  <summary><b>How do I transfer my project to DTU's HPC cluster?</b></summary>

  1. **On your own computer**, navigate through a terminal to the directory **CONTAINING** your project directory.
      - Example: If your project is in `~/DTU/12345/project_directory`, navigate to `~/DTU/012345`.
  0. Run `scp -r project_directory s123456@transfer.gbar.dtu.dk:project_directory`
  0. Wait for the upload to finish

  If the above fails, contact [HPC support](https://www.hpc.dtu.dk/) for more information and guidance.
</details>

<details>
  <summary><b>Where are my script's output, log, and errors?</b></summary>

  In a bunch of files in a hidden directory called `.sprinkle` in your project directory.
</details>

<details>
  <summary><b>My script doesn't work on DTU's HPC cluster.</b></summary>

  Check the error, log, and output files with `sprinkle view error job_id`, 
  where `job_id` is for your failed job.

  The error, log, and output files can also be found 
  in a hidden directory called `.sprinkle` in your project directory.
</details>

<details>
  <summary><b>How do I connect to DTU's HPC cluster?</b></summary>

  Use `ssh s123456@login.hpc.dtu.dk` or `ThinLinc` to connect to DTU's HPC cluster.
  If you use `ssh` remember to run `linuxsh` to not overload the login node.
  Contact [HPC support](https://www.hpc.dtu.dk/) for more information and guidance.
</details>

<details>
  <summary><b>How do I enable developer mode for sprinkle?</b></summary>

  Add a file called `DEVELOPER-MODE` to `~/sprinkle/tmp/`.
  The next call to sprinkle will switch branches and recreate the environment.
  Remove the file to leave developer mode upon the next call to sprinkle.
