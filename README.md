</details>


# üëâ Usage
1. **On your local machine**
    1. Activate your project's environment with `conda activate <environment name>`.
    0. In your project directory, export your packages with `conda env export > environment.yml`.
    0. Transfer project directory to DTU's HPC cluster with e.g. `scp` or `ThinLinc`. 
2. **On DTU's HPC cluster**
    1. Run `sprinkle start` in your project directory and follow the interactive guide.
    0. Run `sprinkle help` to view other commands.


# üìñ Frequently asked questions
<details>
  <summary><b>My single conda environment is a mess, I do not want to export it.</b></summary>

  There are multiple solutions. However, remember the `environment.yml` file 
  should be created **before transfering your project to DTU's HPC cluster**.

  - __**Create a new environment**__
    1. Run `conda create -n new_environment_name`
    0. Run `conda activate new_environment_name`
    0. Run `conda install <package_name1> <package_name2> ...`
        - Example: `conda install python pip`
    0. Run `pip install <package_name1> <package_name2> ...`
        - Example: `pip install matplotlib numpy`
    0. Finally, run `conda env export > environment.yml`
  - __**Manually write the `environment.yml` file**__
    1. Create a new file called `environment.yml`
        - Example: `touch environment.yml`
    0. Write your environment file
        - Example:
            ```yaml
            name: new_environment_name
            channels:
              - defaults
              - conda-forge
              - pytorch
            dependencies:
              - python
              - pip
              - pytorch
              - pytorch-cuda
              - torchvision
              - torchaudio
              - pip:
                - tqdm
                - opencv-python
            ```

  Test your code with your new environment on your own computer first.
  It is much easier to find and fix issues there than on DTU's HPC cluster.

<details>
  <summary><b>How do I transfer my project to DTU's HPC cluster?</b></summary>

  1. **On your own computer**, navigate through a terminal to the directory **CONTAINING** your project directory.
      - Example: If your project is in `~/DTU/12345/project_directory`, navigate to `~/DTU/012345`.
  0. Run `scp -r project_directory s123456@transfer.gbar.dtu.dk:project_directory`
  0. Wait for the upload to finish
</details>

<details>
  <summary><b>Where are my script's output, log, and errors?</b></summary>

  In a bunch of files in a hidden directory called `.sprinkle` in your project directory.
</details>

<details>
  <summary><b>My script doesn't work on DTU's HPC cluster.</b></summary>

  Check the error, log, and output files with `sprinkle view error job_id`, 
  where `job_id` is for your failed job.

  The error, log, and output files can also be found 
  in a hidden directory called `.sprinkle` in your project directory.
</details>

<details>
  <summary><b>How do I connect to DTU's HPC cluster?</b></summary>

  Use `ssh s123456@login.hpc.dtu.dk` or `ThinLinc` to connect to DTU's HPC cluster.
  If you use `ssh` remember to run `linuxsh` to not overload the login node.
  Contact [HPC support](https://www.hpc.dtu.dk/) for more information and guidance.
</details>

<details>
  <summary><b>How do I enable developer mode for sprinkle?</b></summary>

  Add a file called `DEVELOPER-MODE` to `~/sprinkle/tmp/`.
  The next call to sprinkle will switch branches and recreate the environment.
  Remove the file to leave developer mode upon the next call to sprinkle.
